This is the main page that ypu will see once you have created your Microsoft Azure account. Once here you will see all the different tabs and menus that can be used to get started. We will just focus on how to create your first Virtual Machine. Lets get STARTED! 
We will first get started by creating our Resource Group. This is where we will place all of our Virtual Machines together so that we have a grouping of all VM's related to a same project and not get them jumbled up.

<p>
While on the Home page you can either go to the search bar and type the words "Virtual Machines", or you can just bring your cursor over the VM logo and click on it. This prompt will appear telling you that there is no VM created, and you will be asked to create one by clicking the create button.

</p>
<p>
Once you have clicked on the create button, you will see a number of options appear. Click on the very top one "Azure Virtual Machines". This is the one that will bring you to the pages where you can go through and customize your VM to your specific liking.
